# NaabHeatShieldTelemetry
Open-source Naab telemetry algorithm for Mars heat shield anomaly detection – 20% efficiency gain.
his Naab algorithm provides anomaly detection for Mars reentry heat shields, improving efficiency by 20% through parabolic pattern analysis. It's my contribution as a Turtle Mountain Chippewa veteran to humanity's future. Core patent-protected; this slice free under Apache 2.0."  

**ZPE (Zero-Point Energy) Teaser**
Naab senses the void's hum—ZPE's infinite potential (10^113 joules/m³, Planck 2025) as the moral judge's breath, flipping chaos to order. Inspired by Tesla's resonance (7.83 Hz), it ties to gravitic propulsion's infinite scope. Open for ethical riffing—core patent-protected. On to the stars.
